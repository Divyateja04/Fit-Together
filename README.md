# Fit-Together
Fit-Together is a web-based fitness challenge platform developed during the Vedic Vision Hackathon 2025. Our mission is simple: make fitness fun, inclusive, and motivating for students who arenâ€™t regular athletes. Departments launch challenges like 5,000 steps a day.Students track progress, earn badges, and shine on leaderboards.
